# Tiny Compiler in Java

This project is a Tiny Compiler implemented in Java, designed to illustrate the fundamental workings of a compiler. The main objective is to apply key concepts from a compilation theory course and gain a deeper understanding of their practical implementation. By building this compiler, the project covers various stages of the compilation process, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and bytecode execution, providing a comprehensive overview of how compilers work.
## üìö **Concepts and Goals**
The goal of this project is to understand the different phases of a compiler and how they interact. This project uses key concepts from a **compilation theory course**, such as:

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizing the input source code.
- **Parsing**: Analyzing the structure of the tokens and generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Semantic Analysis**: Validating the program‚Äôs semantics, such as variable declarations and usage.
- **Code Generation**: Converting the AST into executable bytecode using Java ASM.
- **Interpretation**: Executing the program line by line to simulate execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Features**
The compiler currently supports the following features:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: 
   - Converts source code into tokens.
   - Supports `VAR` (variables), `EQUALS_OPERATOR` (assignment `=`), and `SHOW` (output).
   - Recognizes integers and variable names.

2. **Parsing**:
   - Parses the tokenized input into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
   - Handles simple statements like `VAR = INT` and `SHOW VAR/INT`.

3. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Ensures that variables are declared before being used in `SHOW`.
   - Verifies that the program follows correct semantics.

4. **Execution**:
   - Implements a basic interpreter to execute parsed statements.
   - Prints values of variables and constants.

5. **Bytecode Generation**:
   - Generates Java bytecode from the AST.
   - Compiles the bytecode into a `.class` file.
   - Executes the compiled bytecode.

6. **Running the Generated Code**:
   - Uses Java's `Runtime.getRuntime().exec` to run the compiled Java class.

## üíª **How It Works**
### 1. **Lexical Analysis**
The compiler first breaks the input code into tokens like variable names, integers, `=` (assignment), and `SHOW` using the **Lexer** class. The tokens represent the basic building blocks of the source code.

### 2. **Parsing**
The tokens are then passed to the **Parser** class, which constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Each node in the AST represents a part of the program, such as variable assignments and `SHOW` statements.

### 3. **Semantic Analysis**
After parsing, the **SemanticAnalyzer** ensures that the program is logically sound. For example, it checks if a variable is declared before being used.

### 4. **Interpretation**
The program is executed by the **Interpreter** class, which evaluates the AST line by line, printing variable values and constants as it encounters `SHOW` statements.

### 5. **Bytecode Generation**
The **BytecodeGenerator** generates Java bytecode from the AST and compiles it into a `.class` file. This bytecode is then executed as a separate Java program.

### 6. **Running the Compiled Program**
The compiled bytecode (`GeneratedProgram.class`) is executed using Java's `Runtime.exec` method, which runs the bytecode as a Java application.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Java ASM**: For bytecode generation.

## üöÄ **How to Run**
1. **Compile the Project**:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

2. **Run the Compiler**:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

3. The compiler will print:
   - **Tokens**: The tokenized input.
   - **AST**: The generated Abstract Syntax Tree.
   - **Semantic Analysis Results**: Whether the program is semantically valid.
   - **Output**: The results of executing the program.

4. The generated bytecode (`GeneratedProgram.class`) will be executed automatically.

## üîß **Future Enhancements**
- **Arithmetic Expressions**: Support for more complex expressions (e.g., `X = 10 + 5`).
- **Variable Types**: Adding support for different variable types, such as integers and strings.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error reporting with line numbers and more descriptive messages.
- **Optimizations**: Implement optional code optimizations.
